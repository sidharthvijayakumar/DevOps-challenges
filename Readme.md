# ðŸš€ Weekly Docker & DevOps Challenges

## ðŸ“Œ About

Every week, I tackle a new hands-on challenge focused on:
- Docker & containerization
- CI/CD & automation
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, OpenTofu, etc.)
- Kubernetes, AWS, and other DevOps tools

Each challenge is designed to sharpen my real-world problem-solving skills while building a portfolio of reusable examples.
